Create empty list of SNP positions
Open file with SNPs:
    For line in file:
        If the line is not the header (first line) and not a duplicate:
            Add SNP position to empty list of SNP positions

Create empty list of gene annotation items
Open file with gene annotations:
    For line in file:
        If line is not header (first line):
            Create gene annotation item for line
            Add item to empty list of annotation items

For every SNP position:
    For every gene annotation item:
        If SNP position falls within gene:
            Print gene description
        Else:
            Test next gene annotation item
    If SNP position not found in any genes:
        Print SNP is intergenic
