This script takes an input fastqc data file (fastqc_data.txt file), parses it,
and outputs a tsv file with filename in one column, and the total number of reads
in that file in the second.

The output file does not have to exist when first running this script. That said,
if the output file already does exist, the script will simply append to it if the
same output file is used for several isolates.

The script takes two arguments:

  fastqc_data_file: this is the fastqc_data.txt file

  outputtsv: this is the output .tsv file
