This script parses two fastq files and outputs the number of reads in each
in a tsv file.

Written originally to produce a tsv file with number of total reads and
number of reads with kmers in them (used after reads with kmers were identified).

It takes three arguments:

    first fastq file

    second fastq file

    output .tsv file
