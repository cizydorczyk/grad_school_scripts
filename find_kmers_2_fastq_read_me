This script takes a fastqc_data.txt file, parses it to obtain a list of the
identified kmers, and then iterates through the corresponding fastq file, writing
reads that contain a kmer to a new file.

The script takes three argumnets:

  fastqcdatafile: this is the fastqc_data.txt file for a given isolate

  fastqfile: this is the fastq file that corresponds to the fastqc_data.txt file
      given as the previous argument (same isolate)

  outputfastqfile: this is the output file, which will contain all reads that had
      at least one kmer in them; if a read contains multiple kmers, it is
      included only once; the output is in fastq format

If a file contains no kmers, then this will simply output a blank file (with
    .fastq extension).
